# minus.js
Modern JavaScript minus all the typing.

`minus` is a minimalist JS library, also available as a Chrome extension. It serves two obvious purposes:

  1. Reduce the amount of _boilerplate_ code you write in a pure JavaScript library. Since it is ultra small, it can easily be included at the top of any library, giving access to all these awesome aliases:
    
    `m.d` for `document`
    
    `m.o` for `Object`
    
    `m.ap` for `Array.prototype`
    
    `m.qs` for `querySelector`
    
    `m.qsa` for `querySelectorAll`
    
    `m.ael` for `addEventListener`
    
    `m.oc` for `Object.create`
    
    `m.ok` for `Object.keys`
    
    `m.aspc` for `Array.prototype.slice.call`

  2. Make debugging apps from the console far faster. If using `minus` as a Chrome extension, you'll have access to all the `m` methods right from the browser `console`.

Pull requests and feedback are welcome.
